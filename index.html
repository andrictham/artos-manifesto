				<h2>☆ &emsp; Why this manifesto?</h2>
				<p>In just a few short years, countless creative industries have been transformed profoundly by the Internet: design, fashion, crafts.</p> 
				<p><strong>The art world hasn’t.</strong> In fact, there is such a huge disconnect between the art and tech worlds that <em>The New York Times</em> called it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/fashion/art-and-techology-a-clash-of-cultures.html" title="NY Times – Does Anyone Here Speak Art and Tech?" target="_blank">“a big problem”</a>. We thought: that’s crazy, right?</p>
				<p><strong>We want to solve this problem.</strong> We’ve imagined one possible future of a better art world, which we present to you as a manifesto, so we can rally talented and passionate people to help make it possible. If you’re skilled in web design or development, <a href="mailto:andric@artos.me" target="_blank">you’re welcome to chip in</a>!</p>

				<h2>1 &emsp; A New Consciousness</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-01.png" alt="A New Consciousness">
				<p>Today, we have more art than ever, but fewer people to appreciate it.</p>
				<p>We feel that art should exist to educate, not to sell. Such enlightenment can only serve to create a larger audience for good art.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column">
				<h2>2 &emsp; New World, New Art, New Tools</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-02.png" alt="New World, New Art, New Tools">
				<p>The digital world ushers in new tools for artists to express themselves.</p> 
				<p>New tools have always brought with it new art. With better-designed tools, we want artists to focus more on creating art, not writing code.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column">
				<h2>3 &emsp; Back to <br/> Basics</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-03.png" alt="Back To Basics"> 
				<p>Museums and galleries have known for a long time of the importance of curation.</p>
				<p>With ever-shrinking attention spans, curation is now more necessary than ever before.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="one-third column">
				<h2>4 &emsp; “Beauty is Embarrassing”</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-04.png" alt="Beauty is Embarrassing">
				<p>The Internet is plagued with bad art, dressed up as beautiful images. </p>

				<p>Beauty is embarassing, and it’s not enough to make good art. It’s like Wayne White says: good storytelling is good business. It’s also good art.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column">
				<h2>5 &emsp; Usability, not Aesthetic</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-05.png" alt="Usability is Aesthetic">
				<p>Art is often confused with design or mashed together with it. But as separate disciplines, design can immensely amplify the voice of art.</p>
				<p>That begins with making art friendlier to outsiders, and the Internet more useable for artists.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="one-third column">
				<h2>6 &emsp; The Museum Without Walls</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-06.png" alt="Museum Without Walls">
				<p>Our world in 2013 is almost borderless. Art shouldn’t have to be confined to Paris, or New York, or Beijing</a>.* </p> 
				<p>(*Internet access required.)</p>

				<h2>7 &emsp; New Art-Science Affinities</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-07.png" alt="New Art-Science Affinities">
				<p>The digital world calls for new craftsmen: scientists & engineers.</p>
				<p>Our wish is for art to coexist with science, not just collide with it. Only then will we have reached the next stage in human evolution.</p>

				<h2 class="darken">★ &emsp; Designer/Coder? <br/>Help make this future a reality</h2>
				<img src="img/icon-08.png" alt="The Future">
				<p>Do you design or code? Are you also interested in art?</p>
				<p>ARTOS is a loose collective of multi-disciplinary creators. We work with artists to make the web a friendlier place.</p>
